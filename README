Take the control of your electric bicycle. Manage the energy consumtion, wireless I/O with RFM12 or bluetooth, the display, the throttle, the charging, every pieces are open source.

**THIS IS ALPHA SOFTWARE/HARDWARE AND SHOULD BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY.**
**IT IS FUN TO GET RUNNING, BUT EXPECT THINGS TO BE BROKEN.**

##Roadmap
This is a long term project, here is the list of the first ideas: 
* Control your ebike kit with our lithium ion battery and our electronics
* Log data, like power, battery voltage, throttle, with bluetooth and android
* Use RFM12b as throttle and battery charge indication
* Create the li-ion battery protection module   
* Use the battery for other target with DC 5V 3A output
